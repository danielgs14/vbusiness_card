You can add your name, title, organization, email, phone, and website. The vCard can be downloaded and the QR code can be scanned to share it quickly.")

st.markdown("This Streamlit app generates vCards (Virtual Business Cards) based on user input. It uses the [vobject](https://github.com/py-vobject/vobject) and [qrcode](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode) modules. I wanted to leverage an easy way to share a vCard during conferences instead of paper ones, so it was easier to create QR codes that everyone could scan. The QR codes can be added into your presentation slides or even as a phone background for easy sharing.")

If you have a website, you can include it. Once finished, you can download the file it generates. In ü•≠ **Generate QR Code**, you will see either one or two QR codes displayed, depending on wether or not you added a website")

st.markdown("Going to a conference and want to share your contact info? Here's an easy way to create a QR code for reading a vCard (virtual business card) object and a website. Instead of relying on paper business cards for conferences and events, I wanted to have QR codes at hand so that people could scan and get my contact info. I updated a version of my phone's wallpaper by adding them in it. This way, I just swap the wallpapers whenever I want to share the information and other people can scan them. I also added the QR codes in my presentation's final slide. You can create a wearable pin, add it to your physical business card or have it printed in a shirt, I don't know. I just use it in my phone. Enjoy!")


st.subheader("How to Use")
st.markdown("In üçâ **Generate vCard**, you will be prompted to input basic information to fill a vCard. Fill in as much as you want, though name and email are required. If you have a website, you can include it. Once finished, you can download the file it generates, a .vcf file. In ü•≠ **Visualize QR Codes**, you will see either one or two QR codes displayed, depending on wether or not you added a website.")

st.subheader("How it works")
st.markdown("This Streamlit app generates vCards (Virtual Business Cards) based on your input. It uses the [vobject](https://github.com/py-vobject/vobject) and [qrcode](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode) modules to create a .vcf file and then create a QR code in PNG format. It is important to note that **no information you enter is logged**. I think Streamlit only logs app views and stuff useful for debugging, but anything added into the text boxes isn't stored.")

I wanted to have the QR codes at hand so I updated a version of my phone's wallpaper by adding them in it. This way, I just swap the wallpapers whenever I want to share the information and other people can scan them. I also added the QR codes in my presentation's final slide. You can create a wearable pin, add it to your physical business card or have it printed in a shirt, I don't know. I just use it in my phone. Enjoy!")

st.markdown("In üçâ **Generate vCard**, you will be prompted to input basic information to fill a vCard. Fill in as much as you want, though name and email are required. If you have a website, you can include it. Once finished, you can download the file it generates. In ü•≠ **Generate QR Code**, you will see either one or two QR codes displayed, depending on wether or not you added a website")

st.subheader("How it works")
st.markdown("This Streamlit app generates vCards (Virtual Business Cards) based on user input. It uses the [vobject](https://github.com/py-vobject/vobject) and [qrcode](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode) modules. I wanted to leverage an easy way to share a vCard during conferences instead of paper ones, so it was easier to create QR codes that everyone could scan. The QR codes can be added into your presentation slides or even as a phone background for easy sharing.")
